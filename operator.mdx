# azure-event-hubs
Event Hubs is a modern big data streaming platform and event ingestion service that can seamlessly integrate with other Azure and Microsoft services. The service can process millions of events per second with low latency. The data sent to an event hub (Event Hubs instance) can be transformed and stored by using any real-time analytics providers or batching or storage adapters.

## Use Cases
Data is valuable only when there's an easy way to process and get timely insights from data sources. Event Hubs provides a distributed stream processing platform with low latency and seamless integration, with data and analytics services inside and outside Azure to build your complete big data pipeline.
### Real-time and batch processing
Ingest, buffer, store, and process your stream in real time to get actionable insights. Event Hubs uses a [partitioned consumer model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-scalability#partitions), enabling multiple applications to process the stream concurrently and letting you control the speed of processing.
### Capture event data
Capture your data in near-real time in an Azure Data Lake Storage for long-term retention or micro-batch processing. You can achieve this behavior on the same stream you use for deriving real-time analytics. Setting up capture of event data is fast. There are no administrative costs to run it, and it scales automatically with Event Hubs [throughput units](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-scalability#throughput-units). Event Hubs enables you to focus on data processing rather than on data capture.
### Event Hubs for Apache Kafka
[Event Hubs for Apache Kafka ecosystems](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/azure-event-hubs-kafka-overview) furthermore enables [Apache Kafka (1.0 and later)](https://kafka.apache.org/) clients and applications to talk to Event Hubs. You don't need to set up, configure, and manage your own Kafka and Zookeeper clusters or use some Kafka-as-a-Service offering not native to Azure.

## Configuration Presets
### Development
### Production

## Design
Our bundle includes the following design choices to help simplify your deployment:
### 1 to 1 ratio of Event Hubs to Event Hub Namespaces
To simplify the deployment, we've chosen to create a 1 to 1 ratio of Event Hubs to Event Hub Namespaces. This means that each Event Hub will be created in its own Event Hub Namespace. This configuration does not incur any additional costs.

## Best Practices
The bundle includes a number of best practices without needing any additional work on your part.
### Scalable
With Event Hubs, you can start with data streams in megabytes, and grow to gigabytes or terabytes. The [Auto-inflate feature](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-auto-inflate) is one of the many options available to scale the number of throughput units or processing units to meet your usage needs.
### TLS Encryption 1.2
Communication between a client application and an Azure Event Hubs namespace is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS is a standard cryptographic protocol that ensures privacy and data integrity between clients and services over the Internet. We've enforced TLS 1.2 as the minimum version for all communication between Event Hubs and client applications.

## Security
### SAS authentication disabled
Shared Access Signature (SAS) authentication is disabled for additional security. SAS authentication is a legacy authentication mechanism that is not recommended for secure applications. We recommend using Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication instead. Learn more about [Authentication and authorization in Azure Event Hubs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/authenticate-application).

## Observability
Massdriver provides you with visibility into the health of your systems. By default, Event Hubs will be created with alarms connected to Massdriver to alert you when performance drops below a key threshold or fails completely. You will be notified when the memory or CPU exceeds 90%, or when server errors exceed 5 in a 5 minute period. All metric values are customizable to fit your application's needs.

## Trade-offs
We do not currently support the following:
* Event Hubs dedicated clusters
* Connecting Event Hubs to blob storage for data capture
* Disabling data capture
* Event Hubs basic tier
* Event Hubs VNet integration (restricts metrics, logs, data capture, and app access)
* Schema registry support

Suggest a feature for this bundle on our [roadmap](https://roadmap.massdriver.cloud/) or [fork the bundle](https://github.com/massdriver-cloud/azure-event-hubs) to publish your own version.
